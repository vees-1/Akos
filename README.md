**Akos** is an offline-first, agentic health system designed to bring life-saving rare disease diagnostics to the world's most remote areas. By leveraging **Small Language Models (SLMs)** on the edge and **Autonomous Agents** in the cloud, Akos solves the "connectivity gap" that renders traditional telemedicine useless in off-grid environments.

## 💡 Why "Akos"?

We chose the name **Akos** because it represents our mission to bring smart, reliable healthcare to everyone, everywhere.

* **The Meaning of "Cure"**: In Ancient Greek, Akos (ἄκος) translates to "remedy," "cure," or "healing". This is the heart of our project: providing a real medical solution for those far from specialized clinics.
* **The Vision of a Falcon**: In Hungarian, Akos means "Falcon." Much like a falcon's keen sight, our AI "sees" and identifies rare diseases with high precision through images.
* **Built to be Tough**: The name represents resilience. We designed Akos to be "Offline-First," ensuring it stays smart and keeps working even without an internet signal.
* **More Than a Chatbot**: In the **Agentic Era**, Akos doesn't just "talk." It is an **Agent** that perceives, reasons, and **acts**—automatically orchestrating referrals and booking appointments once a connection is found.
