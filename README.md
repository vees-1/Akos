## Why "Akos"?

The name **Akos** was chosen to reflect the technical sophistication of our architecture and the human-centric goal of our mission.

* **Etymological Roots**: In Ancient Greek, **ákos** (ἄκος) translates to **"remedy," "cure," or "healing"**. This is the foundation of our mission: providing a fundamental medical remedy to underserved regions.

* **Falcon-Like Precision**: In Hungarian, Akos means **"Falcon,"** symbolizing the keen vision and speed required for our image-based diagnostic AI.

* **Resilience in the Field**: The name represents **resilience and patience**, reflecting our "Offline-First" design that ensures life-saving triage continues even when the digital grid fails.

* **The Agentic Mandate**: As we move into the **Agentic Era**, Akos represents a shift from passive data collection to active intervention—acting as a digital remedy that perceives, reasons, and executes care for patients in remote areas.

By combining ancient wisdom with cutting-edge **Edge SLM (Phi-3)** and **Azure AI Agent** technology, Akos is more than an application; it is a resilient global remedy.
